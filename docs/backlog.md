## Prompt assembly and retry architecture audit

**Context:** `--retry "feedback"` was implemented using multi-turn messages (assistant: previous output, user: feedback + rewrite directive). This exposed a deeper inconsistency worth fixing properly.

### The problem

Two incompatible patterns coexist:

- **Edit** (`_do_retry_mutation`): single-turn. The original selection is embedded inline in the instruction with an explicit label (`PASSAGE TO REVISE — replace this and only this`). The system prompt says "your output is inserted verbatim in place of the passage." Scope is unambiguous even without multi-turn context.
- **Write / play / design / advance** (`_do_retry`): multi-turn. Previous output as `assistant` turn, feedback + "Rewrite from scratch" as `user` turn. But the system prompts for these operators say nothing about replacement scope, so the model may treat the conversation as additive rather than substitutive.

### What to audit and decide

1. **Replacement clarity in system prompts.** Write/play/advance/design system prompts currently frame the model as a writer/designer/GM — they say nothing about what happens on retry. Either (a) add a conditional reminder when `retry=True` is in play, or (b) accept that multi-turn with an explicit user directive is sufficient, and verify empirically.

2. **Multi-turn vs. inline for both.** Decide on one pattern:
   - *Inline (edit's way):* embed previous output inside the user turn with a label. Simpler, unambiguous, but loses the naturalness of conversational refinement.
   - *Multi-turn (feedback's way):* keep assistant+user turns, but also update edit's retry to use the same pattern (currently edit retry on feedback just replaces the prompt — it never shows the model what it previously wrote).
   The multi-turn pattern is better aligned with how instruction-tuned models are trained (they see correction loops in training data). Inline is safer for models without strong multi-turn fine-tuning.

3. **Prompt cache friendliness.** `assemble_prompt` returns `[system, user]` — a stable prefix if system prompt + knowledge + passage don't change. Appending `[assistant, user]` turns is fine for cache: the prefix is still intact and cacheable; only the suffix varies. The current implementation is actually cache-friendly by accident. Worth verifying this is intentional and that no call site rebuilds messages in a way that shifts the cache boundary.

4. **`assemble_prompt` and pinned_ids.** `CrawlResult` carries `pinned_ids` but `assemble_prompt` doesn't use them — callers reconstruct them from params. Worth checking whether knowledge assembly order is deterministic (cache-stable) across calls with the same KB state.

5. **Consistency check:** `_do_retry` (inline operators) and `_do_retry_mutation` (edit) should be brought to parity on the feedback path. Right now only inline operators capture previous content for feedback; edit ignores it and just replaces the prompt.
